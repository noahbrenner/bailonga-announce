New to our event? We are a friendly, casual, fun group of Argentine tango dancers who love to learn, experiment and dance to good music. On most nights, you’ll dance tango to a mixture of traditional, Nuevo and alternative (non-tango that’s fun to dance to) music and make sure to make it to our live music events and special guest instructors hosted multiple times a year. We would love to introduce you to Argentine Tango in Eugene, Oregon!
